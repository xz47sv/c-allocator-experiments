# C Allocator Experiments

This repo contains a Zig like allocator API implementation in C.

It lacks error handling and docs, and was only made for fun, but the logic
inside is sound and I plan to use this in my C projects.

I do not encourage anyone to directly copy and paste this, but if you wanted to
do so the license is Unlicense and you are free to do whatever the fuck you
want with this.
